## Hi there üëã

I'm Robert, a software designer and developer from Vancouver. I love working with innovative technologies and learning new things, which has led me to become a full-stack developer working on anything from cross-platform apps to XR experiences and video games.

These days I'm looking for work and keeping myself busy by working on a personal Flutter project. Before that, I spent 3 years working as a Mixed Reality Software Developer at Clirio, where I developed cross-platform XR GIS apps in Unity with C#, and got to work with technologies like ASP.NET Blazor and Three.js.

My background is very interdisciplinary, I've always had an inexhaustible curiosity and love for digital media, which led me to attend Simon Fraser University (SFU), where I earned my Bachelor's Degree of Science with a major in Interactive Arts & Technology. In this program, I learned the principles of Design, Media Arts, and Programming, in a highly collaborative and iterative environment. These experiences have shaped me into a designer who emphasizes the user experience, a developer who values scalability and accessibility, and an expert in rapid prototyping.

**Contact me if you would like to make cool stuff together! I'm currently looking for work.**
